# Coffe machine implementation

## 1. FEATURE - Simple Coffe implementation
We need to implement Coffe machine with 3 flavours:

- Espresso : 
    -   50ml Water
    -   18g coffe
    -   price 1.50$
- Latte :
    - 200ml Water
    - 24g Coffe

    - price 2.5$
- Cappuccino :

    - 24g Coffe
    - 100ml Milk
    - price 3$

Coffe machine has starting resources : 300ml Water, 200ml Milk, 100g Coffe.

## 2. FEATURE - Coin operated

We will use four coin types :

-  Penny - 0.01$
- Nickle - 0.05$
- Dime - 0.10$
- Quarter - 0.25$

## Program Requirements

1. Print report - print all resources that we have.
2. Check if resources are sufficient when user orders drink.
3. Process coins. You can insert coins one by one. If there are no sufficient funds, print out "Sorry, that's not enough money. Money refunded." If you overpay, machine returns change!
4. Check if transaction is successful?
5. If transaction is succesfull, make coffe!
